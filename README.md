# Natural-Language-Processing-using-Tensorflow

The repository contains code snippets snippets in five parts.

1. Tokenization, Sequencing and Padding - In this module, basic tokenization, sequencing and padding have been added which lies at the heart of dealing with Text data.
2. Building Classifiers using Tensorflow - This module introduces the concepts of building Neural Network Based classifiers using Tensorflow.
3. Sequence 2 Sequence Modelling - In this module, LSTMs and GRUs have been used for developing models to classify data.
4. Building Classifiers from pre-trained Word Embeddings - This module introduces the concepts of Transfer learning, wherein pre-trained word embeddings from Glove have been used as inputs to Neural Networks.
5. Text Prediction using Tensorflow based learning - In this module, we build models which try to predict words in incomplete sentences.
